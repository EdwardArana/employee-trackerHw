# employee-trackerHw

The Employee Tracker app is a command-line tool that an employer can use to keep track of departments, employees, roles and salaries. With this command-line app, you can: view all employees (which displays all of the employees' information), view employees by role, create a department, create a role, add an employee or even update an employee. Once the initial option is selected, the app takes you through a string of questions and then renders the new information in the form of a table.
